# Connect4-with-AI
The goal of this project is to recreate the popular game ‘Connect 4’. We intend to have both single and multiplayer modes with the single player mode played against an AI. The AI will be constructed using the minimax algorithm and optimized using alpha beta pruning and tabulation. Finally, we will add a graphic user interface. This project is a part of Envision 20-21.
